# 👋 Hey, I'm Artur Wagner

I'm a self-taught developer focused on building clean, functional and user-centered applications.  
Currently shaping my path toward full-stack engineering, combining strong front-end craft with growing back-end expertise.

## 🧠 Focus & Philosophy

I treat software development like a craft, structure, discipline and clarity matter as much as code itself.  
My goal is to build real-world solutions that blend solid engineering with thoughtful design.  
Every project is a step toward becoming a versatile, product-oriented developer.
