# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Artur

I'm a self-driven developer with a clear mission: grow into a full-stack engineer ready to deliver real impact.  

Currently focused on solid foundations with JavaScript, TypeScript and React, while expanding into Node.js and databases. For me, coding itâ€™s about discipline, structure and turning ideas into products that work.

## ðŸš€ Skills

- **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React, Node.js, Express  
- **Databases:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Docker, REST APIs  

## ðŸ”¥ What Drives Me

Iâ€™m not chasing shortcuts. Iâ€™m building consistency through daily study and real-world projects, refining both technical and problem-solving skills. My goal is to become adaptable and ready for the challenges of modern software development.  

## ðŸŒ± Currently Exploring

- Advanced React patterns (Context, Reducer, hooks optimization)  
- Full-stack integration with Node.js + databases  
- Testing, clean code and deployment best practices  

## ðŸ’¼ Projects

Projects in progress â€” built to be more than portfolio items, but proof of consistency and growth.
